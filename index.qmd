Joel H. Nitta

# [Set up](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html)

## Example data

- Download [shell-lesson-data.zip](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.

- Unzip/extract the file. **You should end up with a new folder called shell-lesson-data on your Desktop.**

## Open a new shell

For instructions by operating system, see the [Shell Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/#where-to-type-commands-how-to-open-a-new-shell)

# [Introducing the shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro.html)

## Human-computer interaction

- Humans interact with computers using **GUI** (graphical user interface) or **CLI** (command-line interface).

- **GUI**: Intuitive, menu-driven, but not efficient for repetitive tasks.

- **CLI** (Unix shell): Efficient for repetitive tasks, automates tasks quickly.

## The Shell {.smaller}

- The shell **interprets** and **runs** the commands typed by the user.

- Popular Unix shell: **Bash** (**B**ourne **A**gain **SH**ell).

- Benefits of using the shell:
  - Automates repetitive tasks
  - Efficient data handling with powerful pipelines
  - Essential for remote machine interaction and high-performance computing
  - Many open-source software programs must be used via a CLI

---

- Today we will learn how to interact with the shell via **commands**

## Shell interface

When you open the shell, you should see something like this:

```
$
```

## Shell interface

- The `$` is the **prompt**, where you type your commands

- Depending on your setup, it may look a little different, for example:

```
nelle@localhost $
```

## `ls`

The first command we will learn is `ls`, which **lists** the content of your current directory (we will come back to this later):

```bash
ls
```

```
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
```

## Nelle's Pipeline

- The example dataset is based on a story about "Nelle Nemo"
  - Context: Nelle Nemo is a marine biologist who samples marine life.
  - Nelle's Goal: Process 1520 samples with `goostats.sh` to measure protein abundance.

Using a GUI, Nelle would need to manually run 1520 files, taking over 12 hours. **Can Nelle do this more efficiently with the shell?**

# [Navigating files and folders](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir.html)

## Questions

- How can I move around on my computer?

- How can I see what files and directories I have?

- How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?

## What is a File System?

- **File System**: Manages files and directories.
  - **Files**: Hold information (data).
  - **Directories** (= Folders): Hold files or other directories.

## Where are we?

Use `pwd` to show your current working directory (where you "are" in your computer)


---

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/filesystem.svg)

## Slashes

- There are two meanings for the `/` character.
  - When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the **root directory**.
  - When it appears inside a path, it’s just a **separator**.

---

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/home-directories.svg)

For example, Nelle's files are stored in `/Users/nelle.`

## List files with `ls`

- Use the `-F` **option** to adjust the output:
  - a trailing `/` indicates that this is a directory
  - `@` indicates a link
  - `*` indicates an executable

```bash
ls -F
```

## Clear the terminal

You can clear a cluttered terminal with `clear`

## Help

Get a help menu by adding `--help`:

```bash
ls --help
```

## Help

Or, add `man` in front of the command:

```bash
man ls
```

## Challenge: `ls` {.smaller}

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/filesystem-challenge.svg){height=250px}

If `pwd` displays `/Users/backup`, and `-r` tells `ls` to display things in reverse order, **what command(s) will result in the following output:**

```
pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/
```

1. `ls pwd`
1. `ls -r -F`
1. `ls -r -F /Users/backup`

## Exploring other directories

```bash
ls -F Desktop
```

## Move into other directories with `cd`

```bash
cd Desktop
cd shell-lesson-data
cd exercise-data
```

## Shortcuts for moving: `..`

`..` takes you one directory higher

```bash
cd ..
```

## Shortcuts for moving: `..`

Note that if you use `ls -a` to show everything, you will see `..`

## Shortcuts for moving: `~`

You can use `~` to move to your **home directory**

## Shortcuts for moving: `-`

You can use `-` to move back to the directory you just came from

## Absolute vs. relative paths

If you type a path that does not start with `/`, it means you are talking about a folder or file **relative to your current location**

If you type a path that starts with `/`, it means you are talking about a path **from the root of the file system**

---

## Challenge: relative paths {.smaller}

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/filesystem-challenge.svg){height=250px}


If `pwd` displays `/Users/thing`, **what will `ls -F ../backup` display?**

1. `../backup: No such file or directory`
1. `2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27`
1. `2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/`
1. `original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/`

## General Syntax of a Shell Command

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/shell_command_syntax.svg)

## General Syntax of a Shell Command

- Options can usually be written in two ways:
  - Long form `--` (`ls --all`)
  - Short form `-` (`ls -a`)
- Spaces matter (`ls-F` means the command "ls-F")
- Capitalization matters (`ls -s` vs `ls -S`)

## Tab completion

The shell will finish typing the names of files and folders for you when you press the tab key

Try it from `~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/`

```bash
ls north-pacific-gyre/
```

```bash
ls north-pacific-gyre/goo
```

(press the tab key twice to see what files start with `goo`)

# [Working With Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create.html)

## Questions

- How can I create, copy, and delete files and directories?

- How can I edit files?

## Make a new directory with `mkdir`

- Make sure we are in `shell-lesson-data`, then enter `exercise-data/writing`

- Have a look around, then create a new directory called `thesis`:

```bash
mkdir thesis
```

## Make a new directory with `mkdir`

You can create a nested directory using `-p`

```bash
mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results
```

Check what you did (`-R` is the option to `ls` that will list all nested subdirectories within a directory):

```bash
ls -FR ../project
```

## Best practices: names for files and directories

1. Don’t use spaces.
2. Don’t begin the name with `-` (dash).
3. Stick with letters, numbers, `.` (period or ‘full stop’), `-` (dash) and `_` (underscore).

## Create a text file

`nano` is a text editor program. It will create a file and open it for editing.

```bash
cd thesis
nano draft.txt
```

---

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/nano-screenshot.png)

Press `Ctrl+o` to save (as indicated by `^O`), then `Ctrl+x` to exit

## Create a text file with `touch`

```bash
touch my_file.txt
```

## Delete a file with `rm`

```bash
rm my_file.txt
```

- `rm` is forever! (no recycle bin). **Be very careful** when you use it.

## Move or rename files and folders with `mv`

Enter `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing`:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing
```

Let's rename `draft.txt`:

```bash
mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
```

(check the results with `ls`)

## Move or rename files and folders with `mv`

- Like `rm`, there is no "undo" button for `mv`: it will over-write any file with the same name, so **use carefully!**

Let's move `quotes.txt` into our current directory:

```bash
mv thesis/quotes.txt .
```

Check `ls thesis`

## Copy files and folders with `cp`

- `cp` is similar to `mv`, but copies instead of moves

```bash
cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
```

## Copy files and folders with `cp`

- Note that you can't just `cp` a folder:

```bash
cp thesis thesis_backup
```

```
cp: -r not specified; omitting directory 'thesis'
```

## Copy files and folders with `cp`

- To copy a folder and all its contents, use the `-r` (**r**ecursive) option

```bash
cp -r thesis thesis_backup
```

## Delete folders with `rm -r`

- Similar to using `-r` for `cp`, you need `-r` to delete a folder:

```bash
rm -r thesis
```

- Again, **be careful!!**

## Moving, copying, or removing multiple files

- You can move or copy multiple files to a folder by typing all the file names first, then the folder last.
  - Let's test this in `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data`:

```bash
mkdir backup
cp creatures/minotaur.dat creatures/unicorn.dat backup/
```

## Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once

- Moving multiple files at once is handy, but that was a lot of typing

- We can use `*` and `?` to match multiple file names. These are called "wildcards"

## Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once

- Consider the files in `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes`:

- `*`: Represents zero or more characters.
  - Example: `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, etc.
  - Example: `p*.pdb` matches `pentane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`.

## Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once

- `?`: Represents exactly one character.
  - Example: `?ethane.pdb` matches `methane.pdb`.
  - Example: `*ethane.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `methane.pdb`.
  - Example: `???ane.pdb` matches `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, `octane.pdb`.

## Wildcard expansion

- Shell expands wildcards to list matching filenames **before running the command**.
- If no match, the wildcard expression is passed as is.
- Example: `ls *.pdf` in a directory with only `.pdb` files results in an error.

## Challenge: List filenames matching a pattern

When run in the `alkanes` directory, which `ls` command(s) will produce this output?

```
ethane.pdb methane.pdb
```

1. `ls *t*ane.pdb`
1. `ls *t?ne.*`
1. `ls *t??ne.pdb`
1. `ls ethane.*`

## Challenge: Organizing {.smaller}

Jamie is working on a project, and she sees that her files aren’t very well organized:

```bash
$ ls -F
analyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat
```

The `fructose.dat` and `sucrose.dat` files contain output from her data analysis. **What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run so that the commands below will produce the output shown?**

``` bash
$ ls -F
analyzed/   raw/
```

``` bash
$ ls analyzed
fructose.dat    sucrose.dat
```

## Challenge: Reproduce a file structure {.smaller}

You’re starting a new experiment and would like to duplicate the directory structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data.

Assume that the previous experiment is in a folder called `2016-05-18`, which contains a data folder that in turn contains folders named raw and processed that contain data files. The goal is to copy the folder structure of the `2016-05-18` folder into a folder called `2016-05-20` so that your final directory structure looks like this:

```
2016-05-20/
└── data
   ├── processed
   └── raw
```

**Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective? What would the other commands do?**

[See answer options here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create.html#reproduce-a-folder-structure)

# [Pipes and Filters](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/04-pipefilter.html)

## Questions

- How can I combine existing commands to produce a desired output?

- How can I show only part of the output?

## Example: how big are the `pdb` files?

- Nelle needs to determine the `pdb` file **with the fewest lines of text** in the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory.

- She can do this with `wc`, which counts text in a file:

```bash
$ wc cubane.pdb
20  156 1158 cubane.pdb
```

- The output shows number of lines, words, and characters

## Use a wildcard to apply `wc` to all files

Check the number of lines of text in all `.pdb` files:

```bash
wc -l *.pdb
```

This works for a few, but what if we had thousands?

## Save output to a text file

Let's send the results to a file with `>` and read out the contents with `cat`:

```bash
wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt
cat lengths.txt
```

(note that `>>` will **add to** an existing file)

## Sort the output

Next, use `sort` to sort the output, then save it to a file, then finally get the first entry of that file with `head`:

```bash
sort -n lengths.txt
sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt
head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt
```

Whew! We did it!

## Challenge: Appending Data {.smaller}

`tail` is similar to `head`, but prints lines from the **end of a file instead**.

Consider the file `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts/animals.csv`. After these commands, select the answer that corresponds to the file `animals-subset.csv`:

```bash
$ head -n 3 animals.csv > animals-subset.csv
$ tail -n 2 animals.csv >> animals-subset.csv
```

1.  The first three lines of `animals.csv`
2.  The last two lines of `animals.csv`
3.  The first three lines and the last two lines of `animals.csv`
4.  The second and third lines of `animals.csv`

## The pipe

- So that worked, but it relied on two intermediate text files (`lengths.txt` and `sorted-lengths.txt`). That is confusing.

- We can streamline the analysis by sending the results of one command directly into the input of another with the pipe: `|`

```bash
sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1
```

## Chaining pipes

- In fact, we can **combine multiple commands with multiple pipes**. That way we don't need any intermediate files!

```bash
wc -l *.pdb | sort -n
wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1
```

---

![](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/fig/redirects-and-pipes.svg)

## Nelle’s Pipeline: Checking Files

- Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines and created 17 files in `north-pacific-gyre`

```bash
cd north-pacific-gyre
wc -l *.txt
```

## Nelle’s Pipeline: Checking Files

- Nelle checks to see if any files are much **shorter** than the others

```bash
wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 5
```

## Nelle’s Pipeline: Checking Files

- Nelle checks to see if any files are much **longer** than the others

```bash
wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -n 5
```

```
 300 NENE02040B.txt
 300 NENE02040Z.txt
 300 NENE02043A.txt
 300 NENE02043B.txt
5040 total
```

- What's that file with a `Z`?

## Nelle’s Pipeline: Checking Files

- All of Nelle's samples should be marked `A` or `B`; by convention, her lab uses `Z` to indicate samples with missing information. To find others like it, she does this:

```
ls *Z.txt
```

- Remember this for future exercises: Nelle will need to select files with `NENE*A.txt` or `NENE*B.txt`

## Challenge: Removing Unneeded Files {.smaller}

Suppose you want to delete your processed data files, and only keep your raw files and processing script to save storage.

The raw files end in `.dat` and the processed files end in `.txt`.

**Which of the following would remove all the processed data files, and *only* the processed data files?**

1. `rm ?.txt`
2. `rm *.txt`
3. `rm * .txt`
4. `rm *.*`

## Challenge: Pipe Reading {.smaller}

A file called `animals.csv` (in the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts` folder) contains the following data:

``` source
2012-11-05,deer,5
2012-11-05,rabbit,22
2012-11-05,raccoon,7
2012-11-06,rabbit,19
2012-11-06,deer,2
2012-11-06,fox,4
2012-11-07,rabbit,16
2012-11-07,bear,1
```

**What are the contents of `final.txt`?** (the `sort -r` command sorts in reverse)

``` bash
$ cat animals.csv | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r > final.txt
```

# [Loops](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/05-loop.html)

## Questions

- How can I perform the same actions on many different files?

## About loops

- **Loops** allow us to repeat the same command as many times as needed
  - reduces typing effort
  - minimizes typing mistakes

## Using loops to extract data {.smaller}

- Scenario: Extract classification from genome files.

- Files: `basilisk.dat`, `minotaur.dat`, `unicorn.dat` in `exercise-data/creatures`

- Structure:
  - 1st line: Common name
  - 2nd line: Taxonomic classification
  - 3rd line: Updated date
  - Following lines: DNA sequences

```bash
head -n 5 basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
```

## Using loops to extract data

Our goal: **Print the classification (2nd line) for each file.**

General form of a loop:

``` bash
for thing in list_of_things
do
    operation_using/command $thing
done
```

## Using loops to extract data

For our situation:

``` bash
$ for filename in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
> do
>     echo $filename
>     head -n 2 $filename | tail -n 1
> done
```

`$filename` is a **variable** that gets filled in by the shell

## A few details... {.smaller}

- The shell prompt changes from `$` to `>` and back again as we were typing in our loop.

- A semicolon, `;`, can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.

- If the *shell* prints `>` or `$` then it expects you to type something, and the symbol is a prompt.

- If *you* type `>` or `$` yourself, it is an instruction from you that the shell should redirect output or get the value of a variable.

- You can put the variable name in curly braces: `${filename}`. This makes it easier to distinguish the variable from surrounding text (like `${file}name`)

## Hint: use meaningful variable names

- In the last example, we used `for filename` and `$filename`, but we could just have easily said `for x` and `$x`. **Is this a good idea?**

. . .

*No*, because it is not clear **what** the variable refers to. It is better to use variable names that convey their meaning.

## Challenge: Variables in loops {.smaller}

This exercise refers to the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes`
directory. `ls *.pdb` gives the following output:

``` output
cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb
```

What is the output of the following code?

``` bash
$ for datafile in *.pdb
> do
>     ls *.pdb
> done
```

Now, what is the output of the following code?

``` bash
$ for datafile in *.pdb
> do
>     ls $datafile
> done
```

Why do these two loops give different outputs?

## Challenge: Limiting Sets of Files (1/2) {.smaller}

What would be the output of running the following loop in the
`shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory?

``` bash
$ for filename in c*
> do
>     ls $filename
> done
```

1.  No files are listed.
2.  All files are listed.
3.  Only `cubane.pdb`, `octane.pdb` and `pentane.pdb` are listed.
4.  Only `cubane.pdb` is listed.

## Challenge: Limiting Sets of Files (2/2) {.smaller}

How would the output differ from using this command instead?

``` bash
$ for filename in *c*
> do
>     ls $filename
> done
```

1.  The same files would be listed.
2.  All the files are listed this time.
3.  No files are listed this time.
4.  The files `cubane.pdb` and `octane.pdb` will be listed.
5.  Only the file `octane.pdb` will be listed.

## Challenge Saving to a File in a Loop (1/2) {.smaller}

In the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory, what is the
effect of this loop?

``` bash
for alkanes in *.pdb
do
    echo $alkanes
    cat $alkanes > alkanes.pdb
done
```

1.  Prints `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, `methane.pdb`, `octane.pdb`,
    `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, and the text from `propane.pdb`
    will be saved to a file called `alkanes.pdb`.
2.  Prints `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, and `methane.pdb`, and the text
    from all three files would be concatenated and saved to a file
    called `alkanes.pdb`.
3.  Prints `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, `methane.pdb`, `octane.pdb`, and
    `pentane.pdb`, and the text from `propane.pdb` will be saved to a
    file called `alkanes.pdb`.
4.  None of the above.

## Saving to a File in a Loop (2/2) {.smaller}

Also in the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory, what
would be the output of the following loop?

``` bash
for datafile in *.pdb
do
    cat $datafile >> all.pdb
done
```

1.  All of the text from `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, `methane.pdb`,
    `octane.pdb`, and `pentane.pdb` would be concatenated and saved to a
    file called `all.pdb`.
2.  The text from `ethane.pdb` will be saved to a file called `all.pdb`.
3.  All of the text from `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, `methane.pdb`,
    `octane.pdb`, `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb` would be concatenated
    and saved to a file called `all.pdb`.
4.  All of the text from `cubane.pdb`, `ethane.pdb`, `methane.pdb`,
    `octane.pdb`, `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb` would be printed to
    the screen and saved to a file called `all.pdb`.

## Nelle’s Pipeline: Processing Files

- Context: Nelle needs to process protein sample files using `goostats.sh`.

- Script: `goostats.sh` calculates statistics from a protein sample file.
  - Takes two arguments:
    - Input file: Raw data file.
    - Output file: File to store calculated statistics.

## Nelle’s Pipeline, step 1

- Nelle decides to build commands step-by-step.

- Step 1: Select the right input files.
  - Criteria: Filenames ending in `A` or `B`, not `Z`.

``` bash
$ cd
$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/north-pacific-gyre
$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt
> do
>     echo $datafile
> done
```

## Nelle’s Pipeline, step 2

- Next step: decide what to call the files that the `goostats.sh` analysis program will create. 

- Prefixing each input file’s name with `stats` seems clear:

``` bash
$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt
> do
>     echo $datafile stats-$datafile
> done
```

## Nelle’s Pipeline, step 3 {.smaller}

- Instead of typing in everything again, press the up arrow key:

``` bash
for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done
```

The `;` has the same effect as a line-break

- Go back into the command with the left-arrow key and edit it:

```bash
for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done
```

## Nelle’s Pipeline, step 4

- Why don't we see any output?

. . .

`goostats.sh` just writes out the results file without printing anything to the screen. Let's kill the script with `Ctrl + c`, then add an `echo` to display the name of the file:

``` bash
for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile;
bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done
```

We can inspect the output by opening another shell window

# [Shell Scripts](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/06-script.html)

## The Power of Shell Scripts

- Scripts are small programs that **automate tasks**.
  - Save frequently used commands in files.
  - Re-run operations with a single command.
    
- Advantages:
  - Speed: Faster execution of repeated tasks.
  - Accuracy: Fewer typos.
  - Reproducibility: Easy to reproduce results later.

## First script

- Navigate to `alkanes/`.
- Create a new script file `middle.sh` and open it with `nano`:

```
cd alkanes
nano middle.sh
```

## First script

Type this in the script (it should look familiar):

```bash
head -n 15 octane.pdb | tail -n 5
```

Now we can run the script:

```bash
bash middle.sh
```

## Using a variable in a script

- This script would be much more useful if we could run it on any file, not just `octane.pdb`.

- Open it again in `nano` and modify it like so:

```bash
head -n 15 "$1" | tail -n 5
```

The `"$1"` means ‘the first filename (or other argument) on the command line’. Try it out!

## About double quotes

- We use the double quotes in case any filenames that you enter may have spaces (otherwise the shell would think they are two arguments)

## Using multiple variables

- We can make our script even more flexible (and useful) by allowing the user to specify the starting and ending lines:

```bash
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
```

- Try it out!

```bash
bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 15 5
```

## Challenge: Variables in Shell Scripts {.smaller}

In the `alkanes` directory, imagine you have a shell script called
`script.sh` containing the following commands:

``` bash
head -n $2 $1
tail -n $3 $1
```

While you are in the `alkanes` directory, you type the following
command:

``` bash
$ bash script.sh '*.pdb' 1 1
```

Which of the following outputs would you expect to see?

1.  All of the lines between the first and the last lines of each file
    ending in `.pdb` in the `alkanes` directory
2.  The first and the last line of each file ending in `.pdb` in the
    `alkanes` directory
3.  The first and the last line of each file in the `alkanes` directory
4.  An error because of the quotes around `*.pdb`

## Adding comments

- We can make our script easier to understanding by providing some **comments** that explain how it works:

```bash
# Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
```

## Processing many files in a script

- So far, we have been able to input one file into a script with something like `"$1"`

- But what if we have many files we want to input?

. . .

Solution: `"$@"`

- `"$@"` means ‘All of the command-line arguments to the shell script’

## Processing many files in a script

- Example: a script to sort files by their length, called `sorted.sh`

``` bash
# Sort files by their length.
# Usage: bash sorted.sh one_or_more_filenames
wc -l "$@" | sort -n
```

Try it!

``` bash
bash sorted.sh *.pdb ../creatures/*.dat
```

## Challenge: Script Reading {.smaller}

For this question, consider the
`shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes` directory once again. This
contains a number of `.pdb` files in addition to any other files you may
have created. Explain what each of the following three scripts would do
when run as `bash script1.sh *.pdb`, `bash script2.sh *.pdb`, and
`bash script3.sh *.pdb` respectively.

``` bash
# Script 1
echo *.*
```

``` bash
# Script 2
for filename in $1 $2 $3
do
    cat $filename
done
```

``` bash
# Script 3
echo $@.pdb
```

## What is `grep`?

- "To grep something" has become a verb kind of like "To google something"

- `grep` is a computer program that searches for text

- Our examples will use haiku about programming that were featured in *Salon* magazine

```bash
cd 
cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing
cat haiku.txt
```

## First `grep` example

- Let's find lines of text with the word `not`:

``` bash
grep not haiku.txt
```

## Matching whole words

- What happens when we search for `The`

``` bash
grep The haiku.txt
```

. . .

- It matches `Thesis`. How can we match only the **whole word** `The`?
  - Use `-w` (for "word")

## Matching phrases

- Use quotes

``` bash
grep -w "is not" haiku.txt
```

. . .

- Actually, it's better to use quotes even with single words to make clear what you are searching for vs. the file you are searching

## Display matching line numbers with `-n`

``` bash
grep -n "it" haiku.txt
```

## Combining options (flags)

- `-n`: Show the line number
- `-w`: Only match whole words
- `-i`: Make search case-insensitive

``` bash
grep -n -w -i "the" haiku.txt
```

(you can also combine these into `-nwi`)

## Inversion

- *Invert* the search (match all **other** lines) with `-v`:

``` bash
grep -nwv "the" haiku.txt
```

## Recursive search

- Match a string in **multiple** files with `-r`:

``` bash
grep -r "Yesterday" .
```

## Regular expressions

- The `re` in `grep` stands for "Regular Expressions"

- Regular expressions are kind of like wildcards: they can match certain patterns in text

- This is one of the most **powerful** features of `grep`

For example, this finds any text with an "o" as the second character (`-E` turns on matching via regular expressions, the `^` matches the start of a line, and the `.` matches any single character):

``` bash
 grep -E "^.o" haiku.txt
```

## Challenge: Using `grep`

Which command would result in the following output:

``` output
and the presence of absence:
```

1.  `grep "of" haiku.txt`
2.  `grep -E "of" haiku.txt`
3.  `grep -w "of" haiku.txt`
4.  `grep -i "of" haiku.txt`

## About `find`

- While `grep` finds lines in files, the `find` command finds files themselves.

Try it out from `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data`:

``` bash
find .
```

## Find directories with `-type d`

``` bash
find . -type d
```

## Find files with `-type f`

``` bash
find . -type f
```

## Find files matching a particular name with `-name`

``` bash
find . -name *.txt
```

. . .

Wait a sec - I thought there were more text files?

- This behavior is because of **shell expansion**
  - bash interpreted this command as `find . -name numbers.txt`

## Find files matching a particular name with `-name`

- We need to prevent the shell from expanding the names of files by putting that part in quotes

``` bash
find . -name "*.txt"
```

## Combining `wc` and `find`

- Let's count lines of text in `.txt` files:

``` bash
wc -l $(find . -name "*.txt")
```

- The code in parenthesis gets run first

## Combining `grep` and `find`

- Let's find txt files that contain the word “searching” by looking for the string ‘searching’ in all the `.txt` files in the current directory:

``` bash
grep "searching" $(find . -name "*.txt")
```

## The power of small programs together

- By combining relatively simple, small programs using techniques like `$()` and the pipe (`|`), we can achieve very powerful results with a small amount of code

- This is the beauty of the shell!

## Challenge: Matching and Subtracting {.smaller}

Remember, the `-v` option to `grep` inverts pattern matching, so that only lines
which do *not* match the pattern are printed. Given that, which of the
following commands will find all .dat files in `creatures` except
`unicorn.dat`? Once you have thought about your answer, you can test the
commands in the `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data` directory.

1.  `find creatures -name "*.dat" | grep -v unicorn`
2.  `find creatures -name *.dat | grep -v unicorn`
3.  `grep -v "unicorn" $(find creatures -name "*.dat")`
4.  None of the above.
